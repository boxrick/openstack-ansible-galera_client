    The upstream yum mirrors for MariaDB have changed their directory
    structure from ``/10.1/centos/7`` to ``/10.1/centos7-amd64/``. The URL
    has been changed, but deployers with an older OpenStack-Ansible deployment
    may need to set ``galera_repo_url`` to match the new directory structure.
